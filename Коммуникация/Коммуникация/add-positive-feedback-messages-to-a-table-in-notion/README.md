This workflow automates the process of analyzing customer feedback from a Typeform survey, categorizing it based on sentiment, and then taking appropriate actions such as creating a Notion page or a Trello card.

Example: A company that collects customer feedback through a Typeform survey can use this workflow to automatically process the feedback. When a customer submits the survey, the workflow will analyze the sentiment of their comments using Google Cloud Natural Language, and then take different actions based on the sentiment score. If the sentiment is positive, it will create a Notion page with the feedback. If the sentiment is negative, it will create a Trello card to track the issue.
