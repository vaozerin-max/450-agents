Example: A logistics company using Onfleet to manage their delivery drivers can set up this workflow to instantly notify their operations team in Slack whenever a new driver is added to the system. This allows the team to quickly welcome the new driver, provide any necessary onboarding information, and ensure a smooth integration into the company's operations.
