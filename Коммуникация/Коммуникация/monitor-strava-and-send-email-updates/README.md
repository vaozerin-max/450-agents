This workflow automatically checks a user's Strava activity data daily and sends an email to their accountability partners if the user's activity level falls below a specified threshold.

Example: A fitness enthusiast wants to stay accountable to their workout routine. They set up this workflow to monitor their Strava activity and notify their accountability partners (e.g., friends, family, or a fitness group) if they haven't been active enough.
