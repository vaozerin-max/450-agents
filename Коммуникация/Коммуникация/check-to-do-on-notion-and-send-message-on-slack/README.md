This workflow automatically checks for incomplete tasks assigned to a specific user in Notion, and sends a direct message to that user in Slack with the task details.

Example: A team manager uses this workflow to stay on top of their team's tasks. Every morning at 8 AM, the workflow checks Notion for any incomplete tasks assigned to the team member "Harshil". If there are any, it sends a direct message to Harshil in Slack with the task details, helping him stay organized and on top of his work.

## What You Can Do
- Automated daily task check in Notion
- Conditional logic to only notify the assigned user
- Direct message delivery in Slack for quick communication
