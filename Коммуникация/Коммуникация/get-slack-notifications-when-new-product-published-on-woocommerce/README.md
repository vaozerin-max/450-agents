This workflow automatically sends a notification to a Slack channel whenever a new product is added to a WooCommerce-powered website.

Example: A small e-commerce business owner uses this workflow to stay informed about new product additions on their website. Whenever a new product is added, the workflow triggers and sends a message to a dedicated Slack channel, providing key details about the new product, such as its name, price, and a link to the product page.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically monitors a WooCommerce website for new product additions
- Sends a formatted Slack message with relevant product information
- Includes a check to ensure the message is only sent for products with a URL containing "/product/"
