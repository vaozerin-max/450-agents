This workflow automates the process of sending a DingTalk message to the appropriate team members whenever a new pull request is created in Azure DevOps, ensuring timely notification and collaboration.

Example: A software development team using Azure DevOps for their project management and source control needs to ensure that the relevant team members are notified whenever a new pull request is created. This workflow can be set up to automatically send a DingTalk message to the appropriate team members, including the pull request details and a list of reviewers, based on the mapping between Azure DevOps user accounts and their corresponding DingTalk contact information.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates with Azure DevOps to capture new pull request creation events
- Leverages a MySQL database to map Azure DevOps user accounts to their DingTalk contact information
- Customizes the DingTalk message content, including the ability to mention specific team members or the entire team
- Sends the DingTalk message using the DingTalk group chat robot webhook
