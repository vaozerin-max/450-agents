This workflow automatically monitors Zalando product prices, updates a Google Sheet with the latest prices, and sends an email notification when a product's price drops below a user-specified alert price.

Example: A small business owner wants to keep track of the prices of certain products on the Zalando e-commerce platform. They can use this workflow to set up price alerts, so they are notified when the price of a product they are interested in drops below their desired threshold. This allows them to quickly take advantage of price reductions and make informed purchasing decisions for their business.

## What You Can Do
- Allows users to add new products to monitor by providing a Zalando product URL and a price alert threshold
- Automatically scrapes the current price of each monitored product and updates a Google Sheet with the latest information
- Sends an email notification when a product's price drops below the user-specified alert price
