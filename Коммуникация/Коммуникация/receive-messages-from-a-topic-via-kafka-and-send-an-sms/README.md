This workflow monitors a Kafka topic, checks if the temperature value exceeds a threshold, and sends a notification via the Vonage API if the condition is met.

Example: This workflow could be used in an IoT application that monitors environmental sensors. When the temperature value from a sensor exceeds a predefined threshold, the workflow triggers a notification to alert the user or system administrator.

## What You Can Do
- Kafka trigger to monitor a specific topic for incoming messages
- Conditional logic to check if the temperature value is above a set threshold
- Vonage API integration to send a notification message when the condition is met
