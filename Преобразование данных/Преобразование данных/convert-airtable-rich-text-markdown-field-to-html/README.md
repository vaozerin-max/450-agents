This workflow automatically updates the HTML version of video descriptions in an Airtable base, either for a single record or for all records, based on the incoming webhook request.

Example: This workflow could be used by a content team that manages a library of video tutorials in Airtable. Whenever a new video is published or an existing video description is updated, the team can trigger the workflow via a webhook, and it will automatically convert the Markdown-formatted video description to HTML and update the corresponding Airtable record(s).

## What You Can Do
- Supports updating a single record or all records in the Airtable base
- Automatically converts Markdown-formatted video descriptions to HTML
- Provides a sticky note with a tutorial video link for reference
