This workflow automatically reads data from a Google Sheet, and then updates two other Google Sheets with the same data on a scheduled interval.

Example: A small business owner could use this workflow to regularly sync data from a master inventory sheet to separate sheets for different departments or locations, ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled data synchronization using a Cron trigger
- Reads data from a specified range in a Google Sheet
- Writes the same data to two separate Google Sheets
- Configurable range and update operation for flexibility
