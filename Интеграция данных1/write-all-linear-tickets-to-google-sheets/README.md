This workflow automatically retrieves all tickets from a specific team in a project management tool (Linear), applies custom fields, and writes the tickets to a Google Sheet.

Example: A project manager or team lead could use this workflow to keep track of all the tickets assigned to their team in a centralized Google Sheet. This could help them monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve team productivity.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves all tickets from a specified team in Linear using GraphQL API
- Applies custom fields (e.g., estimate, labels) to each ticket
- Writes the tickets to a designated Google Sheet, allowing for easy analysis and reporting
- Handles pagination to retrieve all tickets, even if they exceed the initial API response limit
- Includes detailed setup instructions and notes to help users configure the workflow for their specific needs
