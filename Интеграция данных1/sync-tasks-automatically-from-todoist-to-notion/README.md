This workflow automatically syncs Todoist tasks with a specific label to a Notion database, and then updates the Todoist task to indicate it has been sent to Notion.

Example: A user has a Todoist project for their work tasks, and they want to keep track of these tasks in a Notion database. They create a "send-to-notion" label in Todoist, and this workflow will automatically fetch those tasks, add them to the Notion database, and update the Todoist task to indicate it has been synced.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled trigger to run the workflow at regular intervals
- Fetches Todoist tasks with a specific label
- Adds the tasks to a Notion database, including the Todoist task ID as a property
- Updates the Todoist task to indicate it has been sent to Notion, and includes a link to the Notion page
