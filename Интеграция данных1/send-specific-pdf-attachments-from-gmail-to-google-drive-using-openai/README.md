This workflow automatically processes email attachments, analyzes their content using OpenAI, and uploads relevant PDFs to a specified Google Drive folder.

Example: A small business owner receives invoices and other financial documents via email. This workflow can be set up to automatically detect and upload relevant PDF attachments (e.g., invoices) to a designated Google Drive folder for easy organization and access.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically processes email attachments and filters out non-PDF files
- Uses OpenAI to analyze the textual content of PDF attachments and determine if they match a specified search term (e.g., "invoice")
- Uploads matched PDF attachments to a designated Google Drive folder for easy access and organization
