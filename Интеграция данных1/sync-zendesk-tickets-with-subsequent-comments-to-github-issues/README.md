This workflow automatically creates or updates a GitHub issue when a new Zendesk ticket is created, providing a seamless integration between customer support and development.

Example: A customer service agent receives a new support ticket in Zendesk. This workflow automatically creates a corresponding GitHub issue, or updates an existing one, with the ticket details, allowing the development team to quickly address the customer's issue.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers on new Zendesk tickets and creates or updates a GitHub issue accordingly
- Automatically adds the GitHub issue number to the Zendesk ticket, providing a clear link between the two systems
- Allows for commenting on existing GitHub issues, keeping all relevant information in one place
