This workflow automatically creates, updates, or deletes Notion database pages based on Jira issue events, providing a seamless integration between the two platforms.

Example: A project manager can use this workflow to track the status of Jira issues in a Notion database, ensuring that the project's progress is always up-to-date and easily accessible.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically creates a new Notion database page when a Jira issue is created, with key details like the issue key, ID, and status.
- Updates the corresponding Notion database page when a Jira issue is updated, keeping the information in sync.
- Deletes the Notion database page when a Jira issue is deleted, maintaining data integrity.
- Utilizes a lookup table to map Jira issue statuses to Notion's select property options, ensuring consistent data representation.
