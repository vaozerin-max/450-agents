This workflow automatically manages GitHub issues by creating, updating, deleting, closing, and reopening Notion database pages based on the actions taken on the issues.

Example: A software development team uses this workflow to track and manage their GitHub issues in a Notion database. Whenever a new issue is opened in GitHub, a corresponding database page is created in Notion. If the issue is edited, deleted, closed, or reopened, the workflow updates the Notion database page accordingly.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically creates Notion database pages for new GitHub issues
- Updates Notion database pages when GitHub issues are edited, deleted, closed, or reopened
- Provides a centralized view of all GitHub issues in a Notion database
