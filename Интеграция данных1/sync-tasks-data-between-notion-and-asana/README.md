This workflow synchronizes tasks between Asana and Notion, automatically creating or updating tasks based on changes in Asana.

Example: A project manager uses this workflow to keep their team's tasks up-to-date across both Asana and Notion. Whenever a task is created or updated in Asana, the workflow automatically mirrors those changes in Notion, ensuring that all team members have access to the latest task information.

## What You Can Do
- Bi-directional task synchronization between Asana and Notion
- Automatic task creation or update based on changes in Asana
- Validation of required task fields (e.g., due date) before updating Notion
