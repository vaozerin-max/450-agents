This workflow automates the process of collecting customer feedback, analyzing the sentiment using OpenAI, and then storing the feedback along with the sentiment analysis in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Example: A company that wants to gather customer feedback and analyze the sentiment can use this workflow. Customers can submit feedback through a form, which triggers the workflow to send the feedback to OpenAI for sentiment analysis. The analyzed feedback is then merged with the original form data and added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for further review and analysis.
