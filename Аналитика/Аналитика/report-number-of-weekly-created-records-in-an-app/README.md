This workflow automatically retrieves new product ideas from a Notion database, filters and summarizes the data, and then sends a Slack message with the number of new UX ideas added in the last 7 days.

Example: A product team could use this workflow to stay on top of new ideas being added to their Notion database. The workflow would run on a weekly schedule, pulling in the latest ideas, filtering for UX-related ones, and sending a summary to the team's Slack channel. This helps the team stay informed and engaged with the ideation process.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled execution to run the workflow on a regular cadence
- Flexible data source integration (can use Notion or any other service)

- Customizable notification channel (Slack, Teams, email, etc.)
