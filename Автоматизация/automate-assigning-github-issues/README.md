# 1442 Automate Assigning Github Issues

This workflow automatically assigns GitHub issues to the issue creator or the commenter who requests to work on the issue, helping to streamline the issue management process.

Example: A software development team using GitHub for project management can set up this workflow to automatically assign new issues to the issue creator or a team member who expresses interest in working on the issue. This helps ensure that issues are quickly assigned and addressed, improving overall team productivity.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically assigns issues to the issue creator if the issue is unassigned and the issue body contains the phrase "assign me"
- Automatically assigns issues to the commenter who requests to work on the issue by including "assign me" in their comment
- Provides a friendly comment to the commenter if the issue is already assigned to someone else

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
