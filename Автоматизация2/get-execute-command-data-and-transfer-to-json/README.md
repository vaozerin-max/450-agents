# 156 Get Execute Command Data And Transfer To Json

This workflow executes a command that returns a JSON object, parses the output, and then uses an if-statement to conditionally process the data.

Example: This workflow could be used to process the output of a command that checks the status of a system or service. If the output indicates a specific condition is met (e.g., a value is true), the workflow can then perform additional actions based on that condition.

## What You Can Do
- Executes a command and captures the output
- Parses the command output as a JSON object
- Conditionally processes the data based on the value of a specific field

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
