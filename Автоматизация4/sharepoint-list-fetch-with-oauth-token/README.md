# 2527 Sharepoint List Fetch With Oauth Token

This workflow automates the process of fetching data from a SharePoint list by generating an OAuth token and using it to make authenticated requests to the SharePoint API.

Example: A marketing team might use this workflow to regularly fetch data from a SharePoint list containing customer information, such as contact details and purchase history. The workflow could be scheduled to run daily or weekly, ensuring the team always has up-to-date customer data without manual intervention.

## What You Can Do
- Generates an OAuth token using client credentials (client ID and client secret) and a tenant ID
- Fetches data from a specified SharePoint list using the generated OAuth token
- Runs on a schedule, allowing for automated and regular data retrieval

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
