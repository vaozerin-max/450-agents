# 2538 Demo Workflow How To Use Workflowstaticdata

This workflow manages the expiration and renewal of an access token, ensuring continuous access to a protected API.

Example: This workflow could be used by a web application that needs to access a third-party API that requires an access token. The workflow automatically checks if the current access token is still valid, and if not, it retrieves a new token and stores it in the workflow's static data for future use.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic access token management: The workflow checks the expiration of the access token and retrieves a new one when necessary.
- Persistent storage of access token: The workflow uses the `workflowStaticData()` function to store the access token and its expiration timestamp, ensuring the token is available across workflow executions.
- Scheduled trigger: The workflow can be triggered on a schedule (e.g., every hour) to proactively check and renew the access token.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)
