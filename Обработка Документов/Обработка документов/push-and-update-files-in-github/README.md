This workflow automates the process of updating a file in a GitHub repository and adding a new file, then pushing the changes back to the remote repository.

Example: A developer or content creator can use this workflow to quickly update the README file in a GitHub repository and add a new Markdown file, all without leaving the n8n interface. This can be useful for making small updates or additions to a project's documentation.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves the current contents of the README file from the GitHub repository
- Appends new content to the README file and creates a new Markdown file
- Commits the changes and pushes them back to the remote GitHub repository
- Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring the local repository path
