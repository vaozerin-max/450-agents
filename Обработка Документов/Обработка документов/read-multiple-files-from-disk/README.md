This workflow allows users to manually trigger the reading and processing of binary files (e.g., images) located in a specific directory.

Example: A marketing team could use this workflow to quickly upload and process a batch of product images for their website or social media campaigns. By triggering the workflow, the team can easily access and work with the images without having to manually locate and open each file.

- Reads binary files (e.g., images) from a specified directory
- Flexible file selection options to target specific file types or locations
