This workflow automatically ingests and embeds content from a Notion knowledge base, stores the embeddings in a Supabase vector store, and provides a conversational interface to query the knowledge base using natural language.

Example: A company maintains a Notion-based knowledge base for their internal teams. This workflow automatically processes new and updated content in the knowledge base, creating vector embeddings and storing them in a Supabase database. Employees can then interact with a chatbot interface to ask questions and receive relevant information from the knowledge base.

## What You Can Do
- Automatic ingestion and embedding of Notion content
- Storage of embeddings in a scalable vector store (Supabase)
- Conversational interface for querying the knowledge base using natural language
