This workflow scrapes Google Maps data efficiently using the SerpAPI service and saves the results to a Google Sheet.

Example: A business owner wants to gather detailed information about local competitors, including their contact details, ratings, reviews, and more. They can use this workflow to automatically scrape this data from Google Maps and have it organized in a Google Sheet for easy analysis.
