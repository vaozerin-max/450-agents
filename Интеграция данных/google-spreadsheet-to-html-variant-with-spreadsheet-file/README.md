This workflow allows users to automatically generate an HTML file from data stored in a Google Sheet, triggered by a webhook.

Example: A small business owner wants to create a weekly report that summarizes key sales data from their Google Sheet. They can set up this workflow to automatically generate an HTML file with the latest data whenever a webhook is triggered (e.g., by a scheduled task or an external system).

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves data from a specific Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API
- Converts the sheet data into an HTML file using the Spreadsheet File node
- Triggers the workflow via a webhook, enabling integration with other systems or scheduling
