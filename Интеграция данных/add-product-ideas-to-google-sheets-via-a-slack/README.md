This workflow allows Slack users to submit new ideas, which are then automatically added to a Google Sheets document, and a follow-up message is sent to the user requesting more details.

Example: A team using this workflow can enable their Slack users to submit new product ideas by typing the `/idea` command in Slack. The workflow will capture the idea and the user's name, add it to a Google Sheets document, and send a message back to the user asking them to provide more details about the idea.

## What You Can Do
- Captures new ideas submitted via a Slack slash command and stores them in a Google Sheets document
- Sends a follow-up message to the user who submitted the idea, requesting more details
- Easily extensible to support additional Slack commands (e.g., `/bug`, `/pain`) to capture different types of feedback
