This workflow allows users to create a new record in a destination system (e.g., Google Sheet, Airtable, or database) by manually triggering the workflow and using mock data from a CRM system.

Example: A sales team member can use this workflow to quickly add new contact information from their CRM system to a centralized database or spreadsheet, without having to manually copy and paste the data.

## What You Can Do
- Manually triggered workflow for on-demand data transfer
- Ability to use mock data from a CRM system (e.g., HubSpot) as the source
- Flexible destination system integration (Google Sheet, Airtable, or database)
