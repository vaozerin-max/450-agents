This workflow automatically triggers a Slack notification whenever a new urgent bug is reported in the "Product & Design" team, allowing for quick response and resolution.

Example: A product manager or developer can use this workflow to stay informed about critical issues that arise in their project, ensuring they are addressed promptly and effectively. Whenever a new urgent bug is logged in the team's project management tool, the workflow will automatically send a notification to the designated Slack channel, allowing the team to take immediate action.

## What You Can Do
- Flexible trigger: The workflow can be triggered by various events, such as new issues in a project management tool, changes in a spreadsheet, or custom webhooks.
- Data transformation: The workflow filters the incoming data to only include urgent bugs and transforms the title to a more readable format.
- Customizable notification: The Slack notification can be customized to include relevant details, such as the issue title and a link to the issue, making it easy for the team to take action.
