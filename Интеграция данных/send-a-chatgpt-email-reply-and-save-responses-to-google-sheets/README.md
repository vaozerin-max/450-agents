This workflow sends a ChatGPT email reply when an email is received from specific email recipients, and saves the initial email and the GPT response to a Google spreadsheet. It also records feedback on the GPT responses, which can be used to fine-tune the model.

Example: A user receives an email from a customer and wants to provide a helpful response using ChatGPT. This workflow would automatically generate a response, send it back to the customer, and store the conversation in a spreadsheet for future reference and model fine-tuning.
