This workflow downloads an XML file, parses its contents, and writes the data to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Example: A user might use this workflow to automatically extract data from an XML file and store it in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for further analysis or reporting.

## What You Can Do
- Fetches an XML file from a specified URL
- Parses the XML content and extracts the relevant data
- Creates a new Google Sheets spreadsheet and writes the data to it
- Handles the asynchronous nature of spreadsheet creation by using a Merge node to wait for the spreadsheet to be created before writing the data
