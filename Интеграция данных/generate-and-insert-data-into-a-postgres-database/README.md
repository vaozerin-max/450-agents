This workflow automatically generates and stores sensor data (humidity readings) in a PostgreSQL database on a regular schedule.

Example: A facility manager could use this workflow to automatically track and record humidity levels in a building, allowing them to monitor environmental conditions and identify any potential issues or trends over time.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled data generation using a Cron trigger
- Randomized sensor data creation with a Function node
- Automated storage of sensor data in a PostgreSQL database
