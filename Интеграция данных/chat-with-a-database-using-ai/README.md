This workflow enables users to interact with a conversational AI agent that can query a Postgres database and provide natural language responses, powered by the OpenAI language model.

Example: A user could use this workflow to ask questions about their company's database, such as "Which tables are available?" or "What are the top 5 products by sales?". The AI agent would then query the database and provide a natural language response, allowing the user to quickly and easily access the information they need.

## What You Can Do
- Integrates with OpenAI's language model to provide advanced natural language processing capabilities
- Connects to a Postgres database to allow the AI agent to query and retrieve data
- Provides a user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the AI agent
