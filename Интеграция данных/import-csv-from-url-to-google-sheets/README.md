This workflow automates the process of downloading a COVID-19 data CSV file, filtering the data to include only DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) countries in 2023, and then uploading the filtered data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

Example: A data analyst or researcher working on COVID-19 trends could use this workflow to regularly update a spreadsheet with the latest data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) without having to manually download and process the CSV file.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically downloads the latest COVID-19 data CSV file from the ECDC website
- Filters the data to include only DACH countries in 2023
- Uploads the filtered data to a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet
- Includes a sticky note with a warning about Google API rate limits and a suggestion to add a "Split In Batches" and "Wait" node to handle larger datasets
