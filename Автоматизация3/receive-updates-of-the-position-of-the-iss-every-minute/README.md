# 880 Receive Updates Of The Position Of The Iss Every Minute

This workflow retrieves and stores the current location data of the International Space Station (ISS) on a regular schedule, filtering out any duplicate data.

Example: A space enthusiast or educator could use this workflow to automatically track and monitor the real-time location of the ISS, which could be useful for educational purposes, space exploration updates, or personal interest.

## What You Can Do
- Retrieves the current location of the ISS (latitude, longitude, and timestamp) from a public API on a regular schedule (every minute)
- Filters out any duplicate location data to ensure only new, unique data is stored
- Stores the location data in the workflow's static data, allowing for easy access and analysis over time

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
Inside our community, I show you:
* The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight
* My "$15k Solution Stack" (n8n + AI framework)
* Word-for-word scripts to close premium deals
* Real examples of my $10k+ builds
* The psychology behind why clients happily pay more
