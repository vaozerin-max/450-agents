# 1415 Plex Automatic Qbittorent Throttler

This workflow automatically manages the throttling of a qBittorrent client based on media playback events (resume, play, pause, stop).

Example: A user has a home media server running qBittorrent to download content. This workflow integrates with the qBittorrent API to detect media playback events and automatically throttle or resume the download speed accordingly, ensuring optimal performance during media playback.

## What You Can Do
- Detects media playback events (resume, play, pause, stop) and adjusts the download throttling accordingly
- Checks the current throttling state and enables or disables throttling as needed
- Supports configurable qBittorrent connection details (username, password, IP, port)

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

⚠️ WARNING: Stop Building Basic Automations For Peanuts. 🚫

Here's the painful truth most won't tell you...

While 90% of builders are stuck selling $500 n8n workflows (and working way too hard)...
I'm consistently closing $6k-13k deals by doing ONE thing differently:
I combine simple automations with custom AI that takes less than a week to build.

Recent client wins:
* Turned a basic invoicing headache into a $6k project that saves my client 20 hours/week
* Built a lead generation machine for law firms - they happily paid $13k (and it runs 24/7)
* Created AI-powered SEO automation that beats funded companies (using $0 in AI costs)

Time to build each solution? Under 2 hours.

But here's what's crazy...
Most automation builders think AI is "too complex" or "too expensive" to add to their stack.
(Meanwhile, I'm charging 10x more for solutions that take the same time to build)

Want to see exactly how I do it?
