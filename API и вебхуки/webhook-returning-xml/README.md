This workflow creates a webhook that accepts JSON data, converts it to XML, and responds with the XML data.

Example: A developer might use this workflow to build a simple API that accepts JSON data, processes it, and returns the data in XML format. This could be useful for integrating with systems that require XML input or for providing an XML-based API endpoint.

## What You Can Do
- Accepts JSON data via a webhook
- Converts the JSON data to XML using the XML node
- Responds with the XML data using the Respond to Webhook node
- Allows for customization of the response headers and body
