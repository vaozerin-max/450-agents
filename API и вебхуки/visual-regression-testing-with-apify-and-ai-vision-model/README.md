This workflow automates a visual regression testing process for websites, using AI-powered image comparison to detect and report changes.

Example: A marketing team responsible for maintaining a company's website could use this workflow to regularly check for unintended changes to their webpages. The workflow generates baseline screenshots, compares them to new screenshots, and creates a report in a project management tool like Linear to track and address any visual regressions.
