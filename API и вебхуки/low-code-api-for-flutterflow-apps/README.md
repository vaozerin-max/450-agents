This workflow sets up a low-code API endpoint that can be used to fetch data from a customer datastore and return it to a Flutterflow app.

Example: A Flutterflow app developer could use this workflow to quickly create an API endpoint that retrieves customer data from a database, transforms it into a format suitable for their app, and responds to a GET request from the Flutterflow app.

## What You Can Do
- Provides a pre-built webhook endpoint that can be easily integrated into a Flutterflow app
- Allows for customization of the data source and transformation steps to fit the specific needs of the app
- Simplifies the process of setting up a backend API for a Flutterflow app, enabling faster development and deployment
