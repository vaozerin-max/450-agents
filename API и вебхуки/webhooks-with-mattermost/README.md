This workflow generates a random cocktail recipe and posts it to a Mattermost channel when a webhook is triggered.

Example: A company's social media team could use this workflow to automatically post a new cocktail recipe to their Mattermost channel every time a customer submits a request for a cocktail recommendation through a web form or messaging app.

## What You Can Do
- Triggers a workflow when a webhook is received, allowing for easy integration with external systems
- Retrieves a random cocktail recipe from an external API and extracts relevant information
- Formats the cocktail details into a formatted message and posts it to a Mattermost channel, including an image of the drink
