This workflow automates the process of crawling and extracting API documentation from the web, analyzing the content to identify API operations, and generating a custom JSON schema for each service.

Example: A company that offers a suite of SaaS products with public APIs could use this workflow to systematically gather and organize API documentation from across their product offerings. The workflow would automatically search for and extract relevant API information, then generate a standardized schema for each product's APIs, making it easier to maintain and share the API documentation.

## What You Can Do
