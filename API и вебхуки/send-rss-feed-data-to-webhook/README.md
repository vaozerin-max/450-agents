This workflow periodically checks an RSS feed, filters the articles based on specific keywords, and stores the unique articles in a MongoDB database, while also sending notifications about the new articles.

Example: A real estate company could use this workflow to automatically monitor industry news and blogs, identify relevant articles about the real estate market or specific properties, and store them in a database for further analysis or sharing with their team.

## What You Can Do
- Scheduled RSS feed monitoring with the ability to manually trigger the workflow
- Filtering articles based on keywords like "realtors" or "real estate"
- Deduplicating articles based on the link URL and storing them in a MongoDB database
- Sending notifications about new articles via a webhook
