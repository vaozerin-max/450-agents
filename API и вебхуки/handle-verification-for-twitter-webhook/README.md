This workflow generates a secure response token by applying a SHA256 HMAC encryption to a webhook input, providing a secure way to authenticate and validate incoming requests.

Example: A company that offers a web service might use this workflow to securely authenticate incoming webhook requests from their customers. When a customer sends a request to the webhook, the workflow generates a secure response token that the customer can use to verify the authenticity of the response, ensuring the integrity of the data exchange.

## What You Can Do
- Secure webhook authentication using SHA256 HMAC encryption
- Flexible configuration options for the encryption process
- Ability to generate a response token that can be used to validate the authenticity of the response
