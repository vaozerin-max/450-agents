This workflow creates a simple API endpoint that generates a Google search URL based on the first and last name provided in the webhook request.

Example: A user could use this workflow to create a custom API endpoint that allows them to quickly generate a Google search URL for a person's name. For example, they could send a request to the API endpoint with the parameters `?first_name=John&last_name=Doe`, and the workflow would respond with the URL `https://www.google.com/search?q=John+Doe`.

## What You Can Do
- Webhook node to create a custom API endpoint
- Set node to generate the Google search URL based on the input parameters
- Respond to Webhook node to return the generated URL to the user
